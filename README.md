<h1 align="center">Ruetify-UI</h1>

Understand your components by your hands🔨. Ruetify-UI is an adherent component library of [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/). To build beautiful [React](https://reactjs.org/) apps knowing what you are doing exactly, most features from Vuetify are kept and My own ideas💡 are also poured in. Customizable, Readable and Helpful.

## Why I Make It🛵

_A good code warrior should excel at making tools at his/her will._  
Luckily I found a couple of splendid ui libraries such as Material-Ui and Vuetify when I dived into React&Vue.  
I appreciated it that they provided me with plenty of good practices.  
I realized I can't dive deeper unless I understand how they are built.  
So I decided to make a "Material-UI" with vue and a "vuetify" with react.  
⚠️This is only for learning and guidance and hope you here could pick up something out of my work.🙃
